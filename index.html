            <b>NOTE</b>: CT.js (CTjs) has ability to run in both browser and Node.js environment. But since moder browsers deny access to a "side resources" all the existing examples run in Node.js environment. It is pretty easy to re-configure them for browsers (just change "crypto engine" for PKI.js).<i></i>
